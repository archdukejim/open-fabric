"""Signature verification of published images (manual 1.14.3.4, decisions 2.1.14.6, 2.1.14.10, 2.1.14.11), against real keyless
signatures in Sigstore's public log. Needs Docker and network access. Run by tests/images/run.sh.

- a real keyless-signed image (cosign's own release, signed by Sigstore's release identity) verifies with its
  signer, and the verified digest is remembered (root-only file), so it is not checked again
- the same image is refused with fabric's signer: a signature by anyone else does not count
- an unsigned image (the pinned Debian base) is refused; so is one whose registry cannot be reached
- a ref not pinned by digest is refused before anything runs
- the deploy step checks only images in use, and does nothing while image_signature_check is false
