"""The `samba` suite, sites joining the root's domain (manual 1.8.8.4, 2.11.2.22 S8.1-S8.2): a root DC (with BIND
serving the AD zone), and a site DC, writable, then another read-only, joining it the way a site's setup does — the
root prepares each site in its domain (prepare_site: OU, groups, service accounts, ACLs, id block, networks, a join
account that expires), the site's deploy_samba writes the join credentials and its compose file joins instead of
provisioning, its convergence then changes only what is the site's (an RODC's only what is local), and finish_join
deletes the join account. Proves: both join into their AD sites; the domain and the site's objects replicate both
ways; the site's agent works at its own DC with the id block the root gave; the join account is gone; an RODC's
convergence writes nothing and refuses writes; the password policy stays the root's; SYSVOL and NETLOGON are not
advertised yet reachable by path, and every DC copies the GPO folders it does not own from their owners over SMB
(S8.4), refusing a GPO whose object moved away from its owner's files.
