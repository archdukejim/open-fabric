# tests/samba

The `samba` suite (manual 2.11.2.13): the Windows domain controller.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `run.py` | Settings (D87, D89), the Administrator's password, the rendered container's hardening, nginx giving up 389/636, the unit |
| `dc.py` | Real containers: a DC from fabric's image run as rendered, deployed and converged by fabric's code (twice: idempotent), the policy and GPOs in place; the address plan (each site's networks converged into AD, read across two sites, an overlap found, a removed network leaving); BIND (fabric's image, sharing the DC's address as on a host) answering the AD zone through DLZ and fabric's zone unchanged, the DC's signed updates accepted; an RODC joining with fabric's image (NTLM forwarded for accounts it does not cache; with the writable DC down, cached people only, no writes); refusals: unsigned updates in either zone, a site admin in another site or its service accounts, a short or wrong password |
| `devices.py` | Devices and device roles on a real DC through fabric's own functions, as the site's agent account: the default roles made once in the organisation's OU, validation and its refusals, effective permissions and VLAN, role membership, certificate links, the audit log |
| `linux_join.py` | Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04 joining a real DC with fabric's `join-linux.sh` as rendered: a wrong root-CA fingerprint refused (nothing changed), a join with a site admin's password and one with a one-time join password, fabric's ids, a PAM logon and a Kerberos ticket, sudo for a site admin and not a person, a person of another site refused by the log-on GPO, cached logons with the DC stopped |
| `gpo.py` | The ADMX editor (`fabricctl gpo`) on a real DC with Samba's own template and fabric's starter: templates loaded, policies listed, text, boolean and list policies set as Windows' editor writes them, replaced, disabled and cleared; the admin GPO linked with its version bumped; refusals |
| `site_join.py` | Sites joining the root's domain: the root prepares each (OU, groups, accounts, id block, an expiring join account), a writable and a read-only site DC join with fabric's deploy and compose file into their AD sites, replication both ways over the site link, the site's agent at its own DC, the join account deleted, writes refused at the RODC |
| `start_bind.py` | BIND beside a test DC, answering the AD zone through DLZ (for suites with more than one DC) |
| `start_dc.py` | A converged DC for any suite that needs AD (tests/keycloak), and its parts (dc_tls, run_dc): fabric's image, hardening, deploy and convergence, a test PKI |
