# tests/pki

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `run.py` | Manual PKI (sign a CSR, generate key + cert, inspect, convert, ledger) and zone TSIG keys against a throwaway CA made with the real Step-CA image, including what must be refused; runs `site_ca.py`, `renewal.py`, `revocation.py` and `acme.py` at the end |
| `site_ca.py` | Federation site CAs: a site's key and request, signing with the root key (own or brought-in), checking and staging the answer, a leaf from the site CA, Step-CA serving with the encrypted site key; the refusals (wrong name, extra names, weak key, byoc without its root key, wrong password, wrong root, another site's key) |
| `renewal.py` | Certificate renewal without containers (2.1.5.4–2.1.5.7): when a certificate is due (age, lifetime, CA, names), the lifetime settings and their refusals, the reload table, the run's record, `fabricctl certs`' flags, the warnings for status, doctor and the web console, the CA's lifetime (the Advanced question; a change refused on an existing CA) |
| `revocation.py` | Revocation without containers (2.1.5.10): revoking by name and serial, the intermediate's and the root's CRLs (openssl verify refuses the revoked, accepts the rest), what nginx and FreeRADIUS are given, the issued list's state, `fabricctl certs revoke` and `issued`, and the refusals (reason, unknown or ambiguous name, already revoked, a root-signed site CA without the root key) |
| `acme.py` | ACME for LAN machines against the real Step-CA image (2.1.5.8): fabric's converged ca.json and ACME template; a machine gets a 47-day certificate over http-01 naming the CRL; refused: a name outside the domain (even when its challenge passes), an address, a name it does not answer for; `fabricctl acme` and its refusals |
