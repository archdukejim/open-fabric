# tests/resolver

The DNS filter's BIND resolver (manual [1.12.2](../../docs/volume_1_description_and_architecture/1.12.2-bind-resolver.md#11221-status))
with real containers.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `run.py` | The converter's cases, the settings that must be refused, then fabric's BIND image as the authoritative server and the resolver run as its rendered compose file says: a client outside the allowed networks refused, fabric's zone never filtered, lists and the owner's rules applied, the logs, a reload, the list job (a changed list reloaded alone, a failed list kept apart), DoT upstream when Cloudflare is reachable; the query-log job parses every line BIND wrote |
| `groups.py` | Client groups and safe search ([1.12.2.15](../../docs/volume_1_description_and_architecture/1.12.2-bind-resolver.md#112215-client-groups-and-safe-search)): the safe-search table, the group settings that must be refused, the views (the most specific address wins, the memory guard), the import of AdGuard's clients; then the resolver with three clients on their own addresses (a group's subnet, an address group inside it, no group): the chain to the main view, everyone's lists for every group, a group's own rules and lists, its allow past everyone's lists, blocked answers never cached in a group's view, strict safe search (YouTube moderate for one group) when the internet is reachable, a group removed |
| `console.py` | The web console's tab without a host: the settings it changes (lists, rules, upstreams, groups, safe search, refused input), fabric-agent's routes and their permissions, the lists job's apply when a list is new, the web UI's post route, the page for each kind of user |
| `querylog.py` | The query log and statistics with a real Postgres: ingesting, rewrites marking their queries (a group's through the main view too), reading on (a rotated file, Postgres down), purging at 7 days while statistics stay, searches, refused input, the database's isolation, the admin-only permission |
