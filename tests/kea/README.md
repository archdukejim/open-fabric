| `run.py` | Kea 3.0 built from fabric's Dockerfile (a wrong signing-key fingerprint refused) and rendered from fabric's templates, with BIND: busybox DHCP clients get pool addresses and reservations, their hostnames are registered in `dhcp.<domain>`, a second client cannot take a registered name, leases listed over the control socket, a restart over the previous run folder (stale PID file), the DDNS key refused outside its zone, container hardening; DHCP management: Kea's own check accepts options, a client class, a subnet's id/name/VLAN and refuses an unknown option without writing; a client gets the global option and a boot-class client gets next-server, boot file and TFTP option; the commands (subnets keep their ids, names/VLANs/pool overlaps refused, options at every level, classes, a change Kea would refuse never saved, everything audited) |
