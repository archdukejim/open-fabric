"""The installer test (manual 3.1.2): `sudo fabricctl setup` driven through a real terminal on a test host, as a
person who gets things wrong would — every question first given answers it must refuse, each refusal checked by its
message, then the good answer. Two runs:
  1. a fresh host with ufw already on: every refusal, then the host firewall declined — setup must stop before any
     step, saying why (2.1.2.12), with nothing started;
  2. the same host again: valid answers (an invalid plan choice and consent answer first), everything allowed —
     setup must finish, then doctor, and the checks a person would make (the domain on IPv4 only, 2.1.6.29; the landing
     page at the host's own name; the host's own ufw rules kept beside fabric's).
The host is left installed for a person to look at. Run from a Linux machine that reaches the host with a key:
    TARGET=tempuser@192.168.5.57 KEY=~/.ssh/fabric-test_ed25519 HOST_IP=192.168.5.57 DOMAIN=home.arpa \\
        python3 tests/host/installer.py
The host needs fabricctl installed (apt) and nothing of fabric's set up (the script uninstalls a previous install).
