             Agent route: POST /v1/dhcp/reservations (dhcp:write), timeout 300 s.
    Inputs:  mac, ip, hostname — str as typed; validated by fabriclib. No actor: the agent uses the token's user.
    Returns: {"reservation": saved dict with "mac" and "ip", "applied": bool, "output": last 2000 chars of apply}.
    Fails:   the call_agent exceptions: AgentError (down/timeout/other status), ValidationError (400), AuthError (401),
             PermissionDenied (403);
             ValidationError for bad values; a failed apply is applied=False (saved anyway).
    Feeds:   webui/routes/post_action for /kea/reservations.
