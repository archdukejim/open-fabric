# Disk encryption with a security key or USB stick (manual)

fabric does not set up disk encryption: it is done once, by you, at the
console. This guide encrypts the disk that holds fabric's data (`/opt` and
`/etc/fabric`) with LUKS2 so that a stolen disk or SD card reveals nothing,
and unlocks it with the **same YubiKey or USB stick** you use to unlock
OpenBao. *Untested with hardware by the fabric project* — follow it on a
spare machine first, and keep a passphrase.

## Before you start

- **Keep a passphrase slot.** A lost key must never lock you out of your
  own disk. Store the passphrase offline.
- **Back up the LUKS header** after every change:
  `sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sdX2 --header-backup-file luks-header.img`
  (keep it offline: with the header and a passphrase the disk opens).
- **One key, two jobs.** A YubiKey unlocks OpenBao through its **PIV**
  application (PKCS#11) and LUKS through **FIDO2**. They are separate parts
  of the key; one YubiKey 5 does both.
- **What is outside `/opt` and `/etc/fabric`?** Keycloak's and Postgres's
  data are under `/opt` unless you moved them (`keycloak_data_dir`,
  `postgres_data_dir`): put them on the volume too. `fabricctl reinstall`
  leaves a backup with plaintext secrets in `/root/fabric-reinstall-<time>/`,
  and `apt purge` exports to `/var/backups/fabric/`: delete those, or keep
  them on the encrypted volume as well.
- **Root or data volume?** Unlocking a **data volume** after boot (below)
  works on Ubuntu 24.04 as installed. Unlocking the **root** filesystem with
  FIDO2 needs systemd in the initramfs: `sudo apt install dracut` (it
  replaces initramfs-tools) — test that path carefully.

## 1. An encrypted volume for fabric's data

On a fresh host, before `fabricctl setup` (or after `fabricctl uninstall
--export`, then `fabricctl restore`):

```bash
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 /dev/sdX2        # asks for the passphrase (keep it)
sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdX2 fabricdata
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L fabricdata /dev/mapper/fabricdata
sudo mkdir -p /srv/fabricdata && sudo mount /dev/mapper/fabricdata /srv/fabricdata
sudo mkdir -p /srv/fabricdata/opt /srv/fabricdata/etc-fabric
# fabric's folders live there, bind-mounted in place:
echo '/srv/fabricdata/opt        /opt         none bind,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/srv/fabricdata 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo '/srv/fabricdata/etc-fabric /etc/fabric  none bind,x-systemd.requires-mounts-for=/srv/fabricdata 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

`/etc/crypttab` (the UUID is the LUKS partition's: `sudo blkid /dev/sdX2`):

```
fabricdata  UUID=<luks-partition-uuid>  none  luks,discard
```

and `/etc/fstab`:

```
/dev/mapper/fabricdata  /srv/fabricdata  ext4  defaults,nofail  0 2
```

## 2a. Unlock with a YubiKey (FIDO2)

```bash
sudo apt install fido2-tools
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto /dev/sdX2          # touch the key
#   add --fido2-with-client-pin=yes to also ask the key's PIN at boot
sudo systemd-cryptenroll /dev/sdX2                              # lists the slots: password + fido2
```

In `/etc/crypttab` add `fido2-device=auto` to the options:

```
fabricdata  UUID=<luks-partition-uuid>  none  luks,discard,fido2-device=auto
```

At boot, systemd asks for a touch of the key (and its PIN, if enrolled so).
A second YubiKey (for your safe): run the enrol command again with it.
To remove one: `sudo systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=<slot> /dev/sdX2`.

## 2b. Unlock with the USB stick

Enrol the stick in fabric **first** (OpenBao → Unlock methods → Add a USB
stick, or `sudo fabricctl vault add-usb /dev/sdX --yes`): fabric erases it
and formats it (ext4, label `FABRIC-KEY`). Then add a LUKS key file next to fabric's
`fabric-vault/` folder — fabric only touches its own files there:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/FABRIC-KEY /mnt
sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/luks.key bs=64 count=1
sudo chmod 0400 /mnt/luks.key
sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdX2 /mnt/luks.key
sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/disk/by-label/FABRIC-KEY        # the stick's UUID
sudo umount /mnt
```

`/etc/crypttab` — the key file is read from the stick, identified by its UUID:

```
fabricdata  UUID=<luks-partition-uuid>  /luks.key:UUID=<stick-uuid>  luks,discard,keyfile-timeout=30s
```

With the stick plugged in the volume opens by itself; without it, after 30 s
the boot asks for the passphrase. If you ever add the stick to fabric again
it is erased: add the LUKS key file again afterwards.

## 3. Check

```bash
sudo reboot
lsblk -f                                       # fabricdata unlocked and mounted
sudo fabricctl doctor
```

Remove the key (or stick) and reboot: the boot must stop at the passphrase
prompt. Rotate: enrol the new key, test, then wipe the old slot.
