# Subordinate CA Infrastructure (Nested Layouts)

The `fabric` infrastructure natively supports multi-tier, nested PKI deployments. This allows you to build a comprehensive hierarchy where a "First Level Intermediate CA" can issue both local application certificates AND sign further Subordinate ICAs for segmented environments (Second Level Intermediate CAs, Third Level, etc.).

### Are Subordinate CAs minted from the Root or the ICA?
When you use `fabric`'s `fabricctl` to mint a subordinate CA, it is **minted and signed by the Intermediate CA**, not the Root CA. The `step-ca` daemon running on your host operates exclusively using the Intermediate CA's private key. The Root CA remains isolated and is not used for day-to-day operations.

    D -->|Signs downstream ICAs| F(Third Level Intermediate CA)

    style F fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Because all intermediate CAs in this chain are ultimately derived from the same Root CA, any device that trusts the Root CA will automatically trust application certificates issued by *any* ICA in the network, establishing seamless mutual trust across all levels.

## Intended Architectural Workflow

A highly secure, best-practice deployment looks like this:
1. **Offline Root CA**: A highly secured, offline machine generates the Root CA and signs the certificate for your **First Level Intermediate CA**. The Root CA then goes offline to protect its private key.
2. **First Level Intermediate CA**: Installed via BYOC (Bring Your Own Certs) on your master infrastructure. This ICA performs two roles:
   - Signs application/leaf certificates for its local network.
   - Generates and signs certificates for downstream **Second Level Intermediate CAs**.
3. **Second Level Intermediate CAs**: Segmented infrastructure deployments that operate independently to sign application/leaf certificates for their respective networks, and potentially sign **Third Level Intermediate CAs**.

## Example Scenario (Deep Nesting)

You can chain ICAs infinitely. Here is an example of a 4-level deep architecture, fully supported by this trust model.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Root[Root CA <br> Offline / Air-Gapped] -->|Trust Anchor| ICA1
    
    ICA1[First Level Intermediate CA <br> e.g., Cloud Master] -->|Issues| App1[Cloud App Certs]
    ICA1 -->|Issues| ICA2
    
    ICA2[Second Level Intermediate CA <br> e.g., Region A] -->|Issues| App2[Region A App Certs]
    ICA2 -->|Issues| ICA3
    
    ICA3[Third Level Intermediate CA <br> e.g., Site 1] -->|Issues| App3[Site 1 App Certs]
    ICA3 -->|Issues| ICA4
    
    ICA4[Fourth Level Intermediate CA <br> e.g., IoT Subnet] -->|Issues| App4[IoT Device Certs]
```
As long as the client devices have the **Root CA** installed, they will implicitly trust `App1`, `App2`, `App3`, and `App4` seamlessly.

## Step 1: Mint the Subordinate CA on the First Level Host

Log in to the host machine running your First Level infrastructure. Use the built-in management script to mint a new intermediate CA certificate.

```bash
sudo fabricctl --mint-certs --intermediate-ca
```

**Interactive Prompts:**
1. **Common Name**: Provide a descriptive name, e.g., `Region A Second Level ICA`.
2. **Path Length**: You will be asked for a `pathLen`. This specifies how many further levels of ICAs this new CA is allowed to issue. For a Second Level ICA that needs to issue Third Level ICAs, specify `1` or greater. If it should only issue leaf certificates, use `0`.
3. **Output directory**: Enter a convenient output directory (e.g., `/tmp/sub-certs`).

This will generate two files in the output directory:
- `Region_A_Second_Level_ICA.crt` (The intermediate CA certificate)
- `Region_A_Second_Level_ICA.key` (The private key for the intermediate CA)

## Hardware Keys: Signing a CSR

If you are using a **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** or a **YubiKey** to store the private key for your Second Level Intermediate CA, you will generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) locally on the hardware instead of letting `fabricctl` generate the key for you.

Once you have your CSR file (e.g., `hardware-key.csr`), you can use the First Level infrastructure's `step-ca` backend to sign it.

1. Transfer your `hardware-key.csr` to the First Level host.
2. Copy it into the step-ca volume:
   ```bash
   sudo cp hardware-key.csr /opt/stepca/data/artifacts/
   ```
3. Use the `step certificate sign` command directly inside the container to sign the CSR using the First Level ICA's private key:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec -it step-ca step certificate sign \
       /home/step/artifacts/hardware-key.csr \
       /home/step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt \
       /home/step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key \
       --profile intermediate-ca \
       --not-after 87600h \
       --password-file /home/step/secrets/password \
       > second_level_ica.crt
   ```
4. You now have a `second_level_ica.crt` that is cryptographically signed by the First Level ICA, while the private key never left your hardware device!

## Step 2: Retrieve the Root CA

You will also need the Root CA certificate. You can download it directly from the First Level PKI web endpoint:

```bash
curl -k -o root_ca.crt https://certificates.top.internal/root_ca.crt
```

## Step 3: Transfer Files to the Subordinate Host

Transfer the required files to the new host machine that will run the Second Level infrastructure:
1. `root_ca.crt` (Root CA)
2. `second_level_ica.crt` (Second Level Intermediate CA)
3. `second_level_ica.key` (Second Level Private Key — **Skip this if using a hardware key**, you will configure HSM access directly in step-ca later)

## Step 4: Configure the Subordinate Deployment

On the subordinate host, configure `custom-vars.yaml` to use the Bring-Your-Own-Certs (BYOC) mechanism. This instructs the installer to use the provided certificates instead of generating its own offline root.

```yaml
# custom-vars.yaml
domain: sub1.internal
# ... other configurations ...

# Enable BYOC and specify the paths to the transferred files
byoc: true
ca_crt_path: /path/to/transferred/root_ca.crt
ica_crt_path: /path/to/transferred/second_level_ica.crt
ica_key_path: /path/to/transferred/second_level_ica.key
```

*(If using a hardware key, deploy without `ica_key_path` and manually configure the `ca.json` KMS block to point to your PKCS#11 module post-deployment).*
