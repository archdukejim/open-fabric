## Prerequisites / Dependencies

The following system packages are automatically installed during setup if they are missing:
- `openssl`
- `ca-certificates`
- `curl`
- `gnupg`
- `ufw`
- `libssl-dev`
- `dnsutils`

The script also handles the installation of **Docker Engine** (if missing), adding the official repository and installing:
- `docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`
- `docker-buildx-plugin`
- `docker-compose-plugin`
- `python3-docker` (Ansible dependency)

## Configure vars

Variables are split across two files. Before installation, copy the provided templates to create your local config files:

```bash
cp custom-vars-tpl.yml custom-vars.yaml
```

- **`custom-vars.yaml`** (repo root) — deployment settings: domain, network, DNS records, PKI identity, infrastructure defaults, Docker container IPs, image refs, port numbers, TSIG key definitions, LDAP groups and OUs. Edit this file to customise your deployment.

`01-gen-vars-and-render-jinja.yml` generates secrets (CA password, one TSIG secret per key, Directory Manager and per-role-account LDAP passwords, Keycloak credentials, the webui OIDC client secret) and writes them to `fabric-secrets.yml` (git-ignored) on the first run; existing secrets are preserved on re-runs. It then loads `custom-vars.yaml` and `fabric-secrets.yml`, renders `fabric/jinja/vars.yaml.j2`, and writes the fully-resolved result to `/tmp/fabric-render/vars.yaml`. All subsequent playbooks read from that rendered file.

Minimum required changes in `custom-vars.yaml`:

```yaml
# ── GLOBAL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
domain: home                    # your internal TLD  (e.g. "lab", "internal")

# ── NETWORK ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
lan_cidr: 10.0.0.0/22           # your LAN subnet
lan_gateway: 10.0.0.1
host_ip: 10.0.3.53              # host machine IP on the LAN

# ── PKI ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
acme_email: admin@email.internal

# ── DNS RECORDS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Zone key must be the static placeholder 'dynamic_zone_var'.
# Templates resolve it to the 'domain' value at render time.
dns:
  dynamic_zone_var:
    zone_authority: true        # emit NS A record pointing to host_ip
    tsig: acme_dns-01           # primary TSIG key for this zone
    A:
    - { name: fabric, ip: "{{ host_ip }}" }
    - { name: nas,  ip: 10.0.3.10 }
    CNAME:
    - { name: dns,  canonical: fabric }
    - { name: ldap, canonical: fabric }
    - { name: ca,   canonical: fabric }
```

Key tunables with their defaults:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `bind_dns_port` | `5353` | Host port mapped to BIND9 container port 53 (`bind_dns_port:53`) — for direct host access and coexistence with other resolvers |
| `bind9_doh_port` | `8053` | BIND9 plain-HTTP DoH port (nginx terminates TLS) |
| `stepca_port` | `9000` | Step-CA HTTPS port |

> **`bind_dns_port`** is the host-side port Docker maps to BIND9's internal port 53 (e.g. `5353:53`). This keeps BIND9 off host port 53 so nginx can own it, while still letting host tools query directly: `dig @<host_ip> -p 5353`. nginx proxies public port 53 → `bind9:53` (container-to-container). nginx's port 53 (and all other LAN-facing ports) is bound to `host_ip` rather than `0.0.0.0` to avoid conflicts with `systemd-resolved`, which holds the loopback interface on Ubuntu.

### Customization Checklist

Before your first install, review and set these in `custom-vars.yaml`.

- [ ] `domain` — your internal TLD
- [ ] `system_timezone` — IANA timezone string
- [ ] `lan_cidr` / `lan_gateway` — your LAN network
- [ ] `host_ip` — host machine's LAN IP
- [ ] `dns_server` — upstream DNS used during bootstrap (only used when `use_host_dns: false`; defaults to using the host's existing resolver)
- [ ] `acme_email` — email for ACME registration
- [ ] `ca_name`, `cert_country`, `cert_org` — CA subject fields
- [ ] `byoc` / `ca_crt_path` / `ica_crt_path` — enable BYOC and point these to an offline PKI generation directory instead of utilizing the dynamic PKI.
- [ ] `dns:` block — A and CNAME records for your hosts
- [ ] `ldap_groups` / `ldap_organizational_units` — directory structure
- [ ] `install_keycloak` / `install_webui` — webui (`mgr.<domain>`) is enabled by default whenever Keycloak is; see [webui.md](webui.md)
- [ ] `tsig_keys` — add non-primary entries for external services that need DNS update rights (optional)
- [ ] `bind_dns_port` — change from `5353` if that port conflicts with an existing service
- [ ] `image_nginx` / `image_bind9` / `image_stepca` / `image_dirsrv` — override to pin images to specific digests or a local registry (optional; defaults to `:latest` tags)

## Generate PKI (optional, before install)

Certificates (such as the ones generated from our standalone [private-root-ca](https://github.com/private-root-ca) repository) are optional. 

If you choose to use an offline Root CA to sign your core TLS infrastructure, you should clone your CA repository (e.g., `private-root-ca`), generate the root and intermediate certificates offline on a secure machine, and never deploy the root key to the target.

Once your CA has generated the files, set them in `custom-vars.yaml`:

```yaml
byoc: true
ca_crt_path: /path/to/my/offline-pki/output/root_ca.crt
ica_crt_path: /path/to/my/offline-pki/output/intermediate_ca.crt
```


> Playbook `01-gen-vars-and-render-jinja.yml` checks for these paths and will leverage them for Step-CA if provided.

---

## Run the Installer

The primary entry point is the `setup.sh` wrapper script. 

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh [flags] [ansible-args]
```

> **Note**: `setup.sh` is fully idempotent. If you make changes to `custom-vars.yaml` (e.g., enabling `byoc`, adding LDAP, or changing port numbers), simply re-run `sudo ./setup.sh` to apply those changes seamlessly.

### Installation Modes

#### `(default mode)`
Full install — bootstraps Ansible, runs the entire playbook.

```bash
# 1. Standard local installation
sudo ./setup.sh

# 2. Standard remote installation
sudo ./setup.sh --remote root@192.168.1.5
```

### Installation Flags

#### Remote Deployment
Deploy the infrastructure to a remote machine instead of `localhost`.

**`-s, --remote <user>@<ip>`**
If the `<user>@<ip>` argument is omitted and the `-s` tag is used as part of a combined short-flag string, the installer will securely prompt you for the target credentials.
```bash
# 1. Deploy remotely using a specific SSH user
sudo ./setup.sh --remote admin_user@192.168.1.5
```

#### Reinstall and Clean Install
These options manage existing state by orchestrating uninstalls and reinstalls safely.

**`-c, --clean-install`**
Runs an uninstallation followed by a fresh installation without needing to authenticate twice.

**`-r, --reinstall`**
Runs a safe uninstallation but preserves your CA infrastructure and service certificates to prevent client trust issues upon redeployment. Note: To ensure idempotency and handle any deployed file structure changes from v1.3.0 and newer, this relies on a native script that recursively identifies and backs up `*.crt`, `*.pem`, and `*.key` files, as well as CA history. 

**Final Deployed Structure:**
When deployed, the infrastructure resides securely in `/opt` (or your chosen `DEPLOY_BASE_DIR`):
*   `/opt/fabric/`: The central brain. Contains `config/` (holding `vars.yaml`, `link-vars.yaml`, and `fabric-secrets.yml`), the deployed python deployment engine (`lib/deploy.py`), and the `fabricctl` script.
*   `/opt/bind9/`: Core DNS service. Contains `config/` (holding `named.conf.*`), `data/` (holding all `db.<zone>` zone data and journals), `log/`, and `cache/`.
*   `/opt/nginx/`: Core reverse proxy. Contains `config/` (`nginx.conf`), `www/` (holding the generated HTML documentation, scripts, and portal assets), and `certs/` (public-facing service certificates).
*   `/opt/stepca/`: Core PKI. Contains `data/` (Internal DB, CA keys in `secrets/`, signed CA certs in `certs/`, and issued leaf certificates in `artifacts/`) and custom `templates/`.
*   `/opt/dirsrv/`: Core directory service (389 Directory Server). Contains `data/` (389-DS `/data`: config, database, logs, and `tls/` with `server.crt`, `server.key`, `ca/*.crt`) and `seed/` (seed LDIFs + `seed.py`).
*   `/opt/webui/`: webui management UI (only when `install_webui`). Contains `webui.json` and `run/web.sock`; the service itself runs on the host as systemd `webui`.
*   `/opt/keycloak/`: Core SSO identity provider. Contains `certs/`.
*   `/opt/postgres/`: Backend DB for Keycloak. Contains persistent `data/`.

*Note: During day-2 operations, `fabricctl --apply` uses an intelligent file-tracking system against this structure. It renders templates to `/tmp/fabric-render/` and compares them against the live `/opt/` files. A container is ONLY restarted if its critical templates or configuration files structurally changed.*

#### Combined Short Flags
You can combine short flags into a single string for rapid execution. If `-s` is included in a combined string without a direct argument, the script will securely prompt you for the remote target.

```bash
# Reinstall remotely, skipping confirmation prompts (Prompts for target)
sudo ./setup.sh -srf

# Clean install remotely on a specific host, skipping confirmations
sudo ./setup.sh -csf admin_user@192.168.1.5
```

#### Extra Ansible Arguments
Any flags not recognized by `setup.sh` are passed directly to `ansible-playbook`.

**`--tags`**
Run specific playbook sections by tag.
```bash
# 1. Re-run only the PKI section locally
sudo ./setup.sh --tags pki

# 2. Re-issue offline Step-CA certs for core services
sudo ./setup.sh --tags service-certs
```

**`--check`**
Dry run the installer (predicts changes without applying them).
```bash
# 1. Dry run the installer locally
sudo ./setup.sh --check
```

---

## Upgrading from OpenLDAP

Installs before 1.5.0 ran `osixia/openldap` in `/opt/openldap`. Re-running `setup.sh` deploys 389-DS alongside it but does **not** move directory data. Follow the migration procedure in [operations.md](operations.md#migrating-from-openldap).

---

## Teardown / Uninstall

To stop and remove all containers (and the `webui` service), remove service accounts, and delete `/opt/{fabric,nginx,bind9,stepca,dirsrv,keycloak,postgres,webui}/`:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --uninstall
# or
sudo ./setup.sh -u
```

### `--force` / `-f`
Skip confirmation prompts when uninstalling or reinstalling.
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh -uf
```
