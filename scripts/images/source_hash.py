"""The source hash of each of fabric's own images (decision 2.1.14.13): what its published image was built from — its
staged build context (packaging/images/stage-contexts.sh: exactly what CI builds) and the pinned base it builds on
(and Kea's pinned packages). The lock records it when an image is pinned; a change to an image's sources without the
image marked `pending` (to be built and published again) is refused, so a stale published image cannot ship.

    python3 scripts/images/source_hash.py            print each image's hash
    python3 scripts/images/source_hash.py --check    exit 1 when a published image's sources changed and it is not
                                                     marked pending (the images suite and CI run this)
