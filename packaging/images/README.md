# packaging/images

One folder per image fabric builds; each is a build context (`Dockerfile` and what it copies). On a host they are
installed as `jinja/<service>/build/`; CI builds and publishes them from the same folders (decision 2.1.1.21, manual
3.14.1).

| `smoke-test.sh` | Runs one built image's program under fabric's settings and checks its labels, before publishing |
