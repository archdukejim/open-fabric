# fabricctl/lib/agent

`fabric-agent` is the root daemon behind the web UI. It runs on the host
(systemd `fabric-agent`) and serves a fixed, permission-checked JSON API over a
unix socket mounted into the unprivileged `fabric-web` container: every route
maps to one fabriclib operation, callers are checked by peer uid and by the
signed-in person's Keycloak token, and every change is audited. It never runs
arbitrary commands.
