    """Purpose: every change this setup run would make outside fabric's own tree, by group (manual 2.7.1.3-3), for the questions asked before the first step.
    Inputs:  v — the planned settings (planned_vars); deploy_base, config_dir, jinja_dir — install paths;
             steps — the setup steps that will run (None: all), so `--step firewall` asks only about the firewall.
    Returns: {group: [change, ...]} in GROUPS order, groups with nothing to change left out.
    Fails:   SetupError from plan_accounts (an id taken by another account); errors of the plan_* functions.
    Feeds:   setup/run_setup (ask_consent)."""
