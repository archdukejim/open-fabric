    """Purpose: Render the Step-CA tab for one sub-view, with the CA summary, linkable devices and the issued list
             where needed.
    Inputs:  h — the request handler (send); ctx — page context; view — str, one of views.STEPCA_VIEWS (anything else
             → 'ca'); status — int, default 200; extra — passed to views.stepca (review, inspected, err, device).
    Returns: the Step-CA page with the given status.
    Fails:   a failing CA summary shows as unreadable and a failing device list as no devices (AgentError,
             ValidationError only); errors from list_issued on the 'issued' view and
             acme_overview on the 'acme' view propagate to handle_request.
    Feeds:   get_page (/stepca) and stepca_post (review and inspect results, validation errors with 400).
