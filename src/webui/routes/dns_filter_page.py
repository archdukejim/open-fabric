    """Purpose: Render the DNS filter tab (manual 1.12.2.14): overview, lists, rules, the query log, settings.
    Inputs:  h — the request handler (send); ctx — page context; query — dict: view (a DNS_FILTER_SECTIONS id; anything
             else is the overview), the query log's search (client, name, blocked "on", limit), msg, err.
    Returns: the page (200). Without dns:filter the overview is None (the query log still shows with dns:querylog);
             a search the agent refuses shows its reason in place of the results.
    Fails:   agent errors other than those two propagate to handle_request (redirect to /login, 503).
    Feeds:   get_page (/dns-filter)."""
