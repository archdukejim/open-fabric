    """Purpose: The Overview tab: one tile per service with a traffic light and a link to its tab; then
             the host changes fabric may make (approved, declined with what that leaves unmanaged).
    Inputs:  ctx — page context (src/webui/session/page_context); services — list of (name, systemd state, container health) from
             agentclient.service_status(); names are described via SERVICES;
             host_changes — agentclient.host_changes(): what fabric may change on the host, by group ([] for an
             install set up before fabric asked).
    Returns: HTML str.
    Fails:   Jinja2 errors propagate (e.g. UndefinedError when the template reads an attribute of a value the caller
             left out).
    Feeds:   src/webui/routes/get_page (/); devserver; tests/webui/test_devserver.py.
