    Inputs:  subnet — its name or network; force — bool. No actor: the agent uses the token's user.

    Fails:   the call_agent exceptions: AgentError, ValidationError (400: what fabriclib refuses), AuthError (401),
             PermissionDenied (403); a failed apply is applied=False (saved anyway).
