def dns_filter_change(what, body):
    """Purpose: Change the DNS filter: a list added or removed, a name allowed or blocked or taken out of the rules, the
             upstreams set (each saved and applied at once), or the lists job started.
             Agent routes: POST /v1/dns-filter/<what> (dns:filter), timeout 300 s.
    Inputs:  what — one of CHANGES; body — the change's fields, as typed (fabriclib checks them).
    Returns: {"result", "applied", "output", "fetching"} (fetch: {"fetching"}).
    Fails:   ValueError for another what (a programming error); the call_agent exceptions: AgentError, ValidationError
             (400: the change refused, nothing saved), AuthError (401), PermissionDenied (403).
    Feeds:   src/webui/routes/dns_filter_post."""
