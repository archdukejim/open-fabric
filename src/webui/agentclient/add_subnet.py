    """Purpose: Add a DHCP subnet (name, VLAN record, router, pools, notes); the agent saves and applies it.
             Agent route: POST /v1/dhcp/subnets (dhcp:write), timeout 300 s.
    Inputs:  network, name, vlan, router, notes, allow_overlap — str as typed; pools — list of "first - last".
             No actor: the agent uses the token's user.
    Returns: {"subnet": saved dict, "applied": bool, "output": last 2000 chars of apply}.
    Fails:   the call_agent exceptions: AgentError, ValidationError (400: what fabriclib refuses), AuthError (401),
             PermissionDenied (403); a failed apply is applied=False (saved anyway).
    Feeds:   src/webui/routes/kea_post."""
