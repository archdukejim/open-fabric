    """Purpose: whether a compose file's locally built image must be rebuilt: missing, built FROM another
             base than its BASE_IMAGE build arg, (Kea) built with another pinned KEA_VERSION, from older build files
             (a BUILD_REV build arg against the org.fabric.rev label), or built for other
             service account ids (a *_UID/*_GID build arg against the org.fabric.ids label) or other services'
             groups (a *_GID build arg without its *_UID against the org.fabric.groups label).
    Inputs:  compose_file — str, path to a rendered docker-compose.yml. Asks Docker via built_from.
    Returns: bool; False when no service has a build section with BASE_IMAGE, KEA_VERSION, BUILD_REV or *_UID.
    Fails:   OSError if the file cannot be read; yaml.YAMLError on invalid YAML; AttributeError if a service's
             `build` is a plain string rather than a mapping.
    Feeds:   deploy/install_service_units (decides whether to run `docker compose build`)."""
