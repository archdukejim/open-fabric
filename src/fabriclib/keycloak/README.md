# fabriclib/keycloak

Keycloak operations over the admin REST API (TLS pinned to the fabric root
CA, admin credentials from fabric's secrets via `load_secrets`: the secrets
file, or OpenBao once imported). Realm, federation and client setup is still
in `src/ux/cli/keycloak_bootstrap.py` (to be split here), whose `Admin`
client these files use.

| `quote.py` | `q`: URL-quote one path or query component |
| `step.py` | One progress line of the configuration |
| `ensure_realm.py` | The realm with its login protections (brute-force lockout, no e-mail login) |
| `ensure_ldap_federation.py` | The user federation to the domain (AD mode, LDAPS to the site's DC; created, or updated in place) |
