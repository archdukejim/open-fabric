    """Purpose: copy a directory tree, setting owner and mode on everything, and say whether anything changed.
    Inputs:  src, dst — directories; uid, gid — owner of every copied directory and file; fmode, dmode — modes.
    Returns: True when dst was created or a file was new or different (compared by content), else False.
             Directories get owner and mode on every call; unchanged files are left as they are.
    Fails:   OSError from listing, copying, chown or chmod. Files in dst that are not in src are kept.
    Feeds:   deploy/* (the fabric tree, web assets, docs, service config trees, build contexts, seeds)."""
