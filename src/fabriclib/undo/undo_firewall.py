def undo_firewall(config_dir):
    """Purpose: undo the `ports`, `firewall` and `own_rules` host changes (manual 2.7.1.5, D121): the ufw rules
             fabric added, the host's own rules it removed put back, its DOCKER-USER rules and their boot unit; ufw
             switched off again if it was off before fabric. When ufw stays
             on (it was on before, or that is not known), fabric's SSH rules stay too: removing them would lock every
             remote admin out of the host.
    Inputs:  config_dir — the install's config folder: the records of what fabric opened (security/ufw_rule RECORDS)
             and whether ufw was on before (<config>/host-originals/ufw.state).
    Returns: list of str, what was done and what was left (ufw's default policy is left as it is).
    Fails:   OSError removing the unit or the records; command failures (ufw, systemctl, iptables) are ignored:
             a rule may be gone already.
    Feeds:   undo/undo_group (`fabricctl setup --undo firewall`), setup/uninstall."""
