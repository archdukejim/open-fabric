    Inputs:  ctx — SetupContext with state loaded (vars, config_dir); group — a groups.GROUPS name; interactive —
             False for --non-interactive; assume_yes — --yes (undo without asking).

             removes those); resolver while use_host_dns is false (BIND needs port 53); an install set up before
