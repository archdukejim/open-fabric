    """Purpose: write the domain controller's files under <deploy_base>/samba during apply (manual 1.6.5): the
             Administrator's password for provisioning and the code that converges the domain inside the DC.
    Inputs:  v — the rendered vars: deploy_base_dir, host_ip, ad_domain. secrets — fabric's secrets
             (ad_admin_password).
             jinja_env — Jinja environment whose first search path holds samba/converge/*.py (an install) or sits
             beside src/containers/samba (a checkout).
    Returns: {"converge": True if the converge code changed, "restart": True if the DC's resolv.conf changed}.
             (The password file is read only when the domain is provisioned: a change to it changes nothing in a
             running domain.) BIND's DLZ files are written when missing, so BIND
             can start; turning DLZ on (and restarting BIND) happens after the domain is converged.
    Fails:   KeyError without ad_admin_password; OSError from creating, owning or writing.
    Feeds:   deploy/deploy_optional_parts (apply); tests/samba.
    Notes:   the folders are root's (the DC runs as root in its container): data/ (0755: the DC serves SYSVOL as each
             user, who must be able to reach it; Samba keeps private/ 0700 and SYSVOL under its own ACLs; etc/ and
