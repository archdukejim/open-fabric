    """Purpose: at the parent (the root, or a site with a writable DC: manual 1.8.8.14), before answering a join
             (manual 1.8.8.4, S8.1): converge the new site in the domain, in the parent's OU —
             its OU and the OUs under it, its groups (`<site>-users`, `<site>-admins`), its service accounts with
             the passwords it is given, its ACLs, its id block, its networks and AD site, its sudo rule and GPOs — and
             make the temporary account its DC joins with (expiring in an hour).
    Inputs:  v — the parent's vars (ad_password_policy, deploy_base_dir (the root CA), webui_admin_group,
             service_users); site — the new site's name; networks — its networks as the join request gives them
             ([{name, cidr, allow_overlap}]); id_block — "first-last" (next_id_block); accounts — {kind: password} for
             agent, keycloak, radius; join_password — the join account's password; container — the parent's DC.
    Returns: list of str, what changed.
    Fails:   ValidationError from run_converge (the DC not running, AD refusing); OSError reading the root CA;
             KeyError for a missing var.
    Feeds:   federation/accept_join."""
