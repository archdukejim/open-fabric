# fabriclib/samba

The optional Windows domain: a Samba AD domain controller on the host's address (manual 2.11.2, 1.6.3). The DC
itself is a container (`templates/samba`, `packaging/images/samba`); what converges the domain runs inside it
(`src/containers/samba`).

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Package marker |
| `deploy_samba.py` | The DC's files under `<deploy_base>/samba`: root-only folders, the Administrator's password file, the converge code |
| `write_bind_dlz.py` | What BIND includes for the AD zone: Samba's DLZ module and the update keytab, once the domain exists (empty before) |
| `suggested_ad_domain.py` | The AD domain setup suggests: a sibling at the top of the organisation's name (D87) |
| `id_range.py` | This site's uid/gid block (the root's starts at today's range start, `posix_id_block` long) |
| `sso_spns.py` | The HTTP SPNs of the site's Kerberos sign-in account (none without Keycloak or Kerberos, or at a read-only DC) |
| `converge_domain.py` | The wanted state handed to the converge code inside the running DC; what changed (after every start and apply) |
| `domain_status.py` | What `fabricctl domain status` shows: the DC, whether it runs, its roles, the policy in force |
| `set_domain_password_policy.py` | Change the password policy in the settings (checked whole, audited); the next apply writes it |
| `run_domain_command.py` | `fabricctl domain status` and `password-policy` (routing only) |
| `gpo_request.py` | One ADMX-editor operation inside the DC (`gpo_tool.py`), the request on stdin |
| `run_gpo_command.py` | `fabricctl gpo load / templates / list / show / set / clear / starter` |
| `domain_overview.py` | The Directory tab's domain section: the DC, the policy, this site's machines |
| `gpo_overview.py` | The Group Policy section: templates, the admin settings GPO, a policy search |
| `set_gpo_policy.py` | Set a policy in the site's admin settings GPO (audited; CLI and web UI) |
| `clear_gpo_policy.py` | Put a policy back to Not configured (audited; CLI and web UI) |
| `run_converge.py` | Hand a wanted state to the converge code inside a DC (stdin) |
| `prepare_site.py` | At the root, before answering a join: the new site converged in the domain, and its join account |
| `finish_join.py` | After this site's DC joined: its join account deleted at the root |
| `replication_status.py` | This DC's inbound replication per partition, read from its own `repsFrom` inside the DC |
| `domain_sites.py` | Every site in the domain, read inside this site's DC (the next id block a join hands out; a site moving here) |
| `list_conflicts.py` | AD's `CNF:` objects: names made on two DCs while apart |
