"""Filter traffic to Docker-published ports (DOCKER-USER chain).

UFW cannot do this: Docker routes published ports through its own
iptables chains before UFW's INPUT rules ever see them. DOCKER-USER is the
chain Docker reserves for exactly this; fabric owns its contents.

Run by `fabricctl setup` and at every boot by fabric-firewall.service:
