    Inputs:  paths — deploy_paths() (jinja: the templates folder); v — rendered vars (the install_* flags of
             OPTIONAL); None: the optional timers are left as they are.
    Returns: True if a unit file changed (systemd reloaded here).
    Fails:   OSError copying or removing the files; systemctl failures are not raised (a host without systemd running,
             such as a render test, keeps the files).
