    """Purpose: the rendered settings that are checked before anything is rendered or installed.
    Inputs:  final_vars — rendered settings; its `dhcp` is replaced by the normalized one, each subnet placed on
             this host's interfaces (place_subnets: fabric's address for it), and `dhcp_served` set (client_networks:
             the subnets and addresses the templates open and listen on, manual 1.10.3.3).
    Returns: None.
    Fails:   ValidationError from normalize_dhcp (DHCP subnets, pools, reservations, dhcp.ntp), place_subnets (an
             interface this host lacks, a subnet on no served interface and not relayed) or normalize_ntp
