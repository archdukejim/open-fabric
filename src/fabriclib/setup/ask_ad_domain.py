             (2.1.6.11: chosen once, permanent; a sibling of fabric's domain suggested). Fabric's directory is a Samba
             AD domain on every install. Its password policy is not asked: a new domain starts from the default
             (collect_vars, 2.1.6.35; 2.1.2.16).
    Inputs:  ctx — SetupContext; reads and sets ctx.vars ad_domain; domain for the suggestion. Interactive.
    Returns: None; ctx.vars["ad_domain"] set (Enter takes the value already set or the suggestion; a domain AD
             cannot use is refused, saying why, and asked again).
    Fails:   EOFError from input().
    Feeds:   setup/collect_vars."""
