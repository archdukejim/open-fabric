def upgrade_vars(data, pinned):
    """Purpose: adjust an existing install's vars before a newer fabric re-renders them, so an upgrade never
             changes a running image, and gets this release's service accounts.
    Inputs:  data — the existing vars dict (modified in place); pinned — collection of image_* keys the admin
             set explicitly (left alone).
    Returns: list of change descriptions (str), one per image_* key dropped and one per service account moved.
             Keys pinned by digest ("@sha256:") are kept; unpinned refs and local build names not in `pinned` are
             deleted, so the release's validated, digest-pinned default applies. service_users entries that are
             exactly a previous release's default (PREVIOUS_ACCOUNTS: same uid and gid, no name) are deleted, so
             the fabric-* account in the 600-649 band applies (the accounts step moves the files); entries the
             admin changed are kept. The console's admin role named fabric-admin (before 0.6.4) becomes
             fabric-console-admin: that name is now the first admin's (2.1.6.33); Keycloak and OpenBao follow at
             their steps, members kept.
    Fails:   never — dict operations only.
    Feeds:   collect_vars (logs each change).
    Notes:   `fabricctl images update` is what changes images (design 2.1.14.3)."""
