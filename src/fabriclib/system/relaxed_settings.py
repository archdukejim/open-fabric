    """Purpose: the security relaxations this host has turned on, so `fabricctl status` and the web UI can show them
             while they are active (global Rule 10; manual 1.2.8). Host changes the admin declined are listed by
             consent_status instead; Docker's userland proxy is listed here too while the DNS filter has client
             groups, because it hides their addresses (1.12.2.15).
    Inputs:  vars_ — the host's vars (image_signature_check, the sign-in settings, install_resolver,
             dns_filter_groups); config_dir — the install's config folder (LOWERED_FILE: sign-in layers lowered with
             `fabricctl security lower`; default vars.yaml's); daemon_json — Docker's daemon settings file.
    Returns: list of {"setting": str, "effect": str}; [] when none is relaxed.
    Fails:   OSError / ValueError for an unreadable LOWERED_FILE.
    Feeds:   system/show_relaxed_settings (`fabricctl status`); fabric-agent GET /v1/relaxed-settings (the web UI's
