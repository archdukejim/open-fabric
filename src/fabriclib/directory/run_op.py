    """Purpose: one directory operation (manual 1.6.3, 2.11.2.16), run inside the DC by src/containers/samba/
             directory_op.py, signed in as this site's fabric-agent account — so AD's per-site limits apply to every
             change fabric-agent makes (1.6.3.6). The request, the account's password included, goes on stdin.
    Inputs:  v — rendered vars (site_name); secrets — fabric's secrets (ad_agent_password); op — str, an operation
             of the DC's directory_ops; args — dict of its arguments (JSON-able); container — the DC's container.
    Returns: the operation's result (JSON-decoded).
    Fails:   ValidationError with a message safe to show: "that name is already taken", "no such entry", "the
             directory refused the change …", "the directory refused it: …" (e.g. a password the policy refuses),
             an operation's own refusal word for word (e.g. "no such user: …"), or "the directory is not reachable"
             when the DC is not running; KeyError without ad_agent_password; subprocess.TimeoutExpired after 60 s.
