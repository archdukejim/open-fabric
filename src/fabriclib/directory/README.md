# fabriclib/directory

fabric's directory on Samba AD (manual 1.6.3, 2.11.2.16): what fabric-agent, setup and the web UI ask of it. Every
operation runs inside the DC (`src/containers/samba/directory_op.py`), signed in as this site's `fabric-agent`
account, so AD's per-site limits apply to it.

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `__init__.py` | Package marker |
| `run_op.py` | Run one directory operation as the site's agent account; refusals as messages safe to show |
| `list_people.py` | The People page: every person and group (never a password) and the Keycloak console link |
| `create_person.py` | A new person in this site (POSIX identity from its block, `<site>-users`, a one-time password) |
| `reset_sign_in.py` | A new one-time password in AD; TOTP removed and sessions ended in Keycloak (fabric groups: admins only) |
| `ensure_admin.py` | Setup's first admin: made once, kept in the web UI's admin group |
| `people_password.py` | A one-time password the domain's policy accepts |
| `constants.py` | Device types, the permission vocabulary (what it grants, what enforces it), name rules, the default device roles |
| `device_overview.py` | Devices (with effective access), roles and the vocabulary from one directory read |
| `list_devices.py` | Devices with their roles, effective permissions and VLAN |
| `list_roles.py` | Device roles by priority, with their member devices |
| `add_device.py` | Add a device naming its roles (audited) |
| `update_device.py` | Change a device's type, MACs, owner, description, enabled flag and roles (audited) |

| `require_device.py` | Refuse unless a device exists (before issuing a certificate for it) |
| `link_device_cert.py` | Record or forget a certificate fingerprint on a device (audited) |

| `update_role.py` | Change a role's permissions, VLAN, priority, description (audited) |
| `remove_role.py` | Delete a role — refused while devices are in it (audited) |
| `common/` | Helpers shared by the device and role operations (see its README) |
| `ensure_default_device_roles.py` | Create fabric's default device roles once, in the organisation's `OU=device-roles` (a marker file keeps a deleted one from coming back) |
| `add_machine.py` | A machine pre-created in this site with a one-time join password (`fabricctl domain add-machine`) |
