    """Purpose: fabric's default device roles (DEFAULT_DEVICE_ROLES) in the organisation's OU=device-roles, created
             once: on a new install. The marker keeps a default role the admin deleted or renamed from coming back.
    Inputs:  v — fabric vars (site_name: the root site); secrets — fabric's secrets (ad_agent_password); marker —
             path of the file that records they were made; container — the DC's container (tests name their own).
    Returns: list of the role names added (empty when the marker exists or they all are).
    Fails:   ValidationError from run_op (the directory unreachable or refusing); OSError writing the marker.
    Feeds:   setup/start_services (the root site)."""
