def set_filter_group(actor, name, clients, source="cli"):
    """Purpose: add a client group to the DNS filter, or change an existing group's clients (manual 1.12.2.15). A new
             group starts with safe search off and nothing of its own: it is answered as everyone until something
             is added. Saved in vars.yaml; applied by the next apply.
    Inputs:  actor — who asks (audit); name — the group's name; clients — its addresses and subnets: a list, or one
             string separated by commas, spaces or new lines; source — "cli" or "web".
    Returns: {"name" (normalised), "clients" (normalised), "added": True for a new group}.
    Fails:   ValidationError from check_filter_settings (a bad or reserved name, no clients, an address that is not
             one, outside the networks answered, inside fabric's own, in another group); nothing is saved then.
             OSError or yaml errors from the vars file and the audit log.
