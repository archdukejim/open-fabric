    """Purpose: a DNS-filter group's clients with its references to Kea's data turned into addresses on every apply
             (manual 1.10.3.7): `dhcp:<subnet name or network>` its network, `device:<reservation hostname or MAC>`
             its reserved address, `vlan:<n>` every DHCP subnet recorded with that VLAN (where an 802.1X role puts
             its devices). Plain addresses and subnets pass through.
    Inputs:  raw — the group's clients setting (a list, or anything: left for _clients to refuse); name — the group
             (for the messages); v — rendered vars: install_kea, dhcp.subnets [{subnet, name, vlan, reservations
             [{mac, ip, hostname}]}].
    Returns: the list with every reference replaced by its addresses (in order), or raw unchanged when it is not a
             list.
    Fails:   ValidationError: a reference while DHCP is off, an unknown kind, or one naming no subnet, reservation or
             VLAN DHCP serves.
