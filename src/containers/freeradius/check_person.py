def check_person(uid, password):
    """Purpose: decide a person joining by password (EAP-TTLS/PAP, inside the TLS tunnel). The password is
             checked by binding to the DC as that person over verified LDAPS, so the domain's lockout policy
             counts network logins; only members of a group mapped in fabric-radius.json "people" may join
             (manual 1.6.3.10).
    Inputs:  uid — str user name (sAMAccountName, must match UID_RE); password — str. Reads fabric-radius.json and
             the people under OU=sites (never the service accounts) with their groups.
    Returns: dict {person, allowed, vlan, reason}; when allowed also "group" (the best mapping). vlan comes from
             the mapping with the lowest priority number that sets one (ties by group name), else None.
    Fails:   ldap errors other than a refused bind (directory down, timeout) and config errors (OSError,
             KeyError) propagate; the caller turns them into Access-Reject.
    Feeds:   fabric_radius._decide_person."""
