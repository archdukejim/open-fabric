# src/containers/samba

Code that runs inside the Samba AD domain controller (manual 2.11.2.15, S1.3), copied to `<deploy_base>/samba/converge`
and mounted read-only. `converge.py` runs as root inside the DC on its own database (no credentials, no network);
`directory_op.py` signs in over loopback LDAP as the site's agent account, so AD's limits apply to it.
