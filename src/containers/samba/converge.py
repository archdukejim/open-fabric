"""Converge fabric's Samba AD domain to what fabric wants (manual 2.11.2.15, S1.3), inside the DC, as root, on its own
database: no credentials, no network. Run after every start and apply by fabriclib/samba/converge_domain:
    docker exec -i samba python3 /fabric/converge.py < state.json
The wanted state comes on stdin as JSON: {"site", "root" (bool), "password_policy" {…}, "networks" [site_networks
items], "root_ca_pem", "id_range", "groups" [{name, gidNumber, description}], "admin_group", "accounts" {name:
password}, "radius_gid", "lan_profile", optional "parent", "rodc", "join_account", "moving" and "sso_spns"} (stdin,
never a command line: it holds the service accounts' passwords). Prints one JSON object: {"changed": [what changed,
…]}. Exits 1 with the error on stderr."""

    """Purpose: every part of the domain fabric owns, in order: the schema, the layout, the site's id block, the
             groups, the site's service accounts, its access entries, its networks (the address plan), its default
             sudo rule, the AD site and its subnets, the password policy, the domain's trust GPO (fabric's root CA),
             the site's log-on GPO, its Windows baseline GPO and winbind's privileged pipe for FreeRADIUS. Each part
             changes only what differs, so a second run changes nothing.
    Inputs:  state — dict: site (str), root (bool: the root site, which also holds the organisation's items and the
             domain-wide trust GPO), password_policy (dict, every key), networks (site_networks' list), root_ca_pem
             (str), id_range ("first-last"), groups (fabric's ldap_groups), admin_group (the web UI's admin group, in
             the log-on policy), accounts ({sAMAccountName: password}: the site's service accounts), radius_gid (int:
             FreeRADIUS's group, given winbind's privileged pipe), parent (str, optional: a site's parent site,
             for the AD site link), rodc (bool, optional: a read-only DC, where
             only winbind's pipe is converged), join_account ({name, password}, optional: at the root, the
             temporary account a new site's DC joins with), moving (bool, optional: at a new parent, a site with its
             own DC moving here: its OU and links only, never its GPOs, which its own DC owns), lan_profile (str:
             the Windows wired 802.1X profile the baseline installs, "" without one), sso_spns (list, optional: the
             HTTP SPNs of the site's Kerberos sign-in account; none, no account), sso_host (str, optional: Keycloak's
             name, which the Windows baseline lets browsers use Kerberos for; "" or none, no allowlist).
    Returns: list of str, what changed.
    Fails:   KeyError for a missing state key; whatever a part raises (ldb.LdbError, OSError, CalledProcessError).
    Feeds:   this script's main."""
