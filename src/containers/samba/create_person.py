def create_person(samdb, lp, site, uid, first, last, email, password, gid, home_base, shell, must_change=True):
    """Purpose: a new person in a site (manual 1.6.3.4, 1.6.3.9, 1.6.3.10): a user in the site's OU=people named by
             its user name, with their POSIX identity (a uid from the site's block, never reused), a member of
             `<site>-users`, and a one-time password they must change at their first sign-in (or, for the first admin,
             the password they chose in setup: 2.1.6.33).
    Inputs:  samdb — SamDB (as the site's agent: AD refuses another site); lp — LoadParm (unused); site — str;
             uid — the user name (checked by the caller); first, last, email — str; password — the one-time
             password (it must satisfy the domain's policy); gid — int, their primary gid (fabric's users: 5000);
             home_base — str (e.g. /home); shell — str (e.g. /bin/bash); must_change — False only for a password the
             person chose themselves (the first admin's, in setup).
    Returns: {"uid", "uidNumber"}.
    Fails:   ldb.LdbError ERR_ENTRY_ALREADY_EXISTS when the user name or the e-mail address is taken anywhere in the
             domain; ERR_CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION when the policy refuses the password; ERR_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS
             outside the agent's site; ValueError when the site's id block is full.
